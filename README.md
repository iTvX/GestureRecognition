# GestureRecognition

Invented a new way to implement hand gesture control. I didn’t see others using LeapC library and C++'s “call function” feature to implement this goal. This application is like a bridge connected to hardware and software. 

However, for this report, the application of hand gesture detection is not limited to AirSim, you can also use it on any other platform, and it’s very easy to implement in the real world. Just Put the Ultraleap in front of you, pre-programmed the drone’s path planning, then assign it to the hand gesture; you can use your hand gesture to control the drones.

### How to run

Simply using Clion and open the C++ file, connect to the Ultraleap, then click run button.
